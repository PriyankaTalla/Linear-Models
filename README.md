## Below are the list of linear models covered in this repository with example

1. Simple Linear Regression

Concepts: Relationship between two variables, line of best fit.

Mathematical Topics:
- Descriptive Statistics: Mean, variance, covariance.
- Algebra: Linear equations, slope, intercept.
- Optimization: Least squares method.

Example: Predicting a studentâ€™s test score based on hours studied.

2. Multiple Linear Regression
   
Concepts: Relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables.

Mathematical Topics:
- Matrix Algebra: Matrix operations, vector spaces.
- Optimization: Gradient descent, normal equation.

Example: Predicting house prices based on size, number of bedrooms, and age.

3. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
   
Concepts: Penalizing large coefficients to prevent overfitting.

Mathematical Topics:
- Regularization: Ridge penalty term.
- Optimization: Regularized least squares.

Example: Predicting house prices with regularization.

4. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
   
Concepts: Encouraging sparsity in the model coefficients.

Mathematical Topics:
- Regularization: Lasso penalty term.
- Optimization: L1 norm minimization.

Example: Predicting house prices with feature selection.

5. Elastic Net
   
Concepts: Combining L1 and L2 regularization.

Mathematical Topics:
- Regularization: Elastic Net penalty term.
- Optimization: Convex combination of L1 and L2 norms.

Example: Predicting house prices with a combination of L1 and L2 regularization.

7. Bayesian Linear Regression

Concepts: Incorporating prior distributions for the coefficients.

Mathematical Topics:
- Probability: Bayesian inference, priors, posteriors.
- Statistics: Conjugate priors, predictive distribution.

Example: Predicting house prices with uncertainty estimation.

8. Generalized Linear Models (GLM)

Concepts: Extending linear models to non-normal distributions.

Mathematical Topics:
- Probability: Exponential family distributions.
- Statistics: Link functions, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).

Example: Predicting counts (e.g., number of customer visits) with Poisson regression.

9. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS)

Concepts: Dimensionality reduction and regression combined.

Mathematical Topics:
- Linear Algebra: Singular value decomposition (SVD).
- Optimization: Minimizing projection error.

Example: Predicting chemical concentrations in a mixture.

10. Quantile Regression

Concepts: Estimating conditional quantiles of the response variable.

Mathematical Topics:
- Optimization: Linear programming, quantile loss function.

Example: Predicting median house prices rather than mean prices.
